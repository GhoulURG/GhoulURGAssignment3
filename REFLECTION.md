What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem? I asked Copilot to make a basic music player that has a like button and a comment section. I broke it down into sections to make it easier.
How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked? Slowly to make sure there were no issues at all.
What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you? Just how easy it looked at making the code and making it look clean.
What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before? Everything in general. This is the first time I used GitHub Copilot.
What would you do differently if you had to build this again? Probably ask it more to make the html a bit more real and organic.
